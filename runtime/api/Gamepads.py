This module contains functions for getting gamepad data.

To use this module, you must first import it:

>>> from api import Gamepads

# Connect to memcache

    >>> gpads = Gamepads.get_all()
    >>> gamepad0 = gpads[0]

    Each returned value is between -1 and 1, which represents where the joystick
    is along that axis. For example, if axes[0] is -1, then the left joystick
    has been pushed all the way to the left. In order to get a better sense of
    the joystick mappings, click the 'Details' button next to a gamepad in Dawn
    or refer to https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/#remapping.

    On a standard gamepad:
    - axes[0] represents the horizontal axis of the left joystick.
    - axes[1] represents the vertical axis of the left joystick
    - axes[2] represents the horizontal axis of the right joystick
    - axes[3] represent the vertical axis of the right joystick
